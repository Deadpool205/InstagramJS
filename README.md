# InstagramJS
Learning instagram JS by building my own Instagram from scratch.

This is a full serverside instagram written in Javascript. This will require time/skill above beginner and a lot of effort, so know this before cloning.

Learning instagram JS and other NODE JS features with guide. GITHUB was easiest way to organize. No instructions given because they are not my own and I do not have the right to share them. The code is hand written from a Udemy class linked here: https://www.udemy.com/share/103hX4CUISdV5TRXo=/ not sure if this is a referral link or not. Do not care either way, this is how it's done. Not a short one, not a cheap one, but to do it right, you gotta put time and effort into it. This will be used in blockchain/dApps later so good luck. This code is not technically licensed as it isn't directly copied and I may add my own spin on it, but the intellectual property belongs to Udemy so be careful if using this for commercial without massive rewrites. If you fork from here, I will provide little to no support (might be in a good mood one day and answer questions) but all responsibility will be your own. I kept this public so my buddy and I could take the course together.
